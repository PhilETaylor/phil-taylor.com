> Senior software developer specializing in PHP, full-stack SaaS architecture, and DevOps. Entrepreneur, founder, pilot, and maritime professional.

I'm a senior software developer with deep expertise in PHP development, SaaS platform architecture, and complete lifecycle DevOps. I specialize in Linux server security and digital data protection, with a track record of discovering and responsibly reporting security vulnerabilities in critical systems.

As an entrepreneur, I've founded multiple digital businesses. Much of my work operates under white label arrangements or NDA, building platforms that power other companies' services.

When not coding, I'm actively engaged in aviation and maritime pursuits as a commercially qualified airplane pilot, flying instructor, and boat owner with multiple commercially endorsed maritime certificates.
